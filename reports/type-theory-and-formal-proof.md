## State of Reading
I started reading this book.

## Contents


### Chapter 6: Calculus of Constructions
This chapter introduces and defines the 位C.
It discusses its relation to the previous systems quite a bit.
It also lists some important properties of the system 位C.


### Chapter 7: The encoding of logical notions in 位C
This chapter gives an explanation and description of how we can encode full propositional logic in the 位-cube.
It begins with an intuitionistic first-order propositional logic and then expands it to classical first-order propositional logic.
The following sections discuss predicate logic, mainly the treatment of the existential as the universal is said to have already been covered in one of the previous chapters.
