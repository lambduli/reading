# Typing Haskell in Haskell

authors: Mark P. Jones

year of publishing: 2000


## State of Reading
I have read the paper while working on my master's thesis. Now, I would like to come back and write the report.


## Contents
A very detailed description of the implementation of a type checker for a simplified Haskell 98. Can be used as a primary resource for implementing HM inference and type classes.


## Conclusion
An extremely valuable resource. This paper can be used as a primary lead in implementing a type-checker for a language like Haskell (98).
