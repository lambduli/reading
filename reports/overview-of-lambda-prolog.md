# An Overview of λ-Prolog

authors: Gopalan Nadathur, Dale Miller

year of publishing: 1988


## Contents
This paper is a nice, light exposure to the design and theory behind λ-Prolog.
It reads well and might serve as a nice introduction to the language and the topics behind it.

From the abstract:
> λ-Prolog is a higher-order logic programming language that extends Prolog by incorporating notions of higher-order function, λ-terms, higher-order unification, polymorphic types, and mechanisms for building modules and secure abstract data types.


### Introduction
This section motivates the research behind λ-Prolog.
It mentions its focus on proof-theoretic semantics and the concept of *higher-order hereditary Harrop* formula. Those play a similar role in λ-Prolog as *Horn Clauses* in Prolog.


### Section 2: Recosidering the Foundation on Horn Clauses

TODO: I have mostly read this section but it's been a while.
I should go over it again and write this part.


### Section 3: Programming Language Consequence
