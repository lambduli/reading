## State of Reading
I have read the paper when working on my master's thesis. Now I am coming back to it for more insight. Specifically, I will try to work my way through the section on type-directed translation.

## Contents
This is one of the most important papers in this category. It gives a very detailed explanation of the extended type-checking algorithm found in (past) Haskell. It also gives a complete implementation in the appendix. This paper can serve as a basis for the implementation of a similar language with bi-directional type-checking.
