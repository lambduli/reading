## Contents
A great tutorial paper describing a simple implementation of a dependently typed language. It is best read after *The Little Typer*.

The paper uses an iterative approach—it starts with an untyped λ-calculus and ends up with a dependently typed one.

The used language has a notion of global definitions, which is nice.

The bidirectional type checking is very much what one would know from [Practical type inference for arbitrary-rank types](../reports/practical-type-inference-for-arbitrary-rank-types.md) only this time we deal with dependent types as well.

The paper does not deal with user-defined data types or universe hierarchy.

It does, however, deal with non-trivial equiality so it is a nice resource worthy reading.
