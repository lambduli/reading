# writing

All of my public, non-academic writing.

## Paper and Book Reports
This is a collection of my (sometimes noticeably WIP) reports from reading papers and books.
The reports always share a common structure and sometimes contain my comments, thoughts, and questions.

TODO: make a list of those, each item could have a short spoiler section containing the **Contents** section from the report.

- [A Polymorphic Type System for Extensible Records and Variants](./reports/plymorphic-type-system-for-extensible-records-and-variants.md)

- [Semantics Engineering with Concrete Syntax](./reports/semantics-engineering-with-concrete-syntax.md)

- [A Short Introduction to System F and Fω](./reports/short-introduction-to-system-f-fω.md)

- [A Solution to Haskell's MultiParameter Type Class Dillema](./reports/solution-to-haskells-multiparameter-type-class-dillema.md)
